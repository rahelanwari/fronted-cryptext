            <p><strong>What is CrypText?</strong></p>
            <p>CrypText is a privacy-first messaging app designed for secure, anonymous communication ‚Äî with no login or account required.</p>
            <p>Users can instantly start chatting in end-to-end encrypted rooms. Each user is assigned a unique 12-word recovery phrase, which can be used to restore their identity on another device if needed.</p>
            <p>CrypText is built for people who value digital privacy, simple communication, and control over their own data.</p>
            <p>No usernames, no email addresses, no tracking ‚Äî just secure messaging.</p>

            <p><strong>Your Privacy. Our Priority.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> All messages are encrypted in your browser before being sent. Only the intended recipient can decrypt and read them.</p>
            <p><strong>No Logins, No Accounts:</strong> You don‚Äôt need to sign up or provide any personal information. Your identity is generated from your 12-word recovery phrase.</p>
            <p><strong>No Data Stored:</strong> We don‚Äôt store any of your messages, metadata, or identity information. Once a message is sent and received, it disappears.</p>
            <p><strong>Zero Tracking:</strong> CrypText uses no cookies, trackers, or analytics tools. We don‚Äôt know who you are ‚Äî and we like it that way.</p>
            <p><strong>Open Source Transparency:</strong> The code behind CrypText is open source. Anyone can review it, verify the encryption methods, or even run their own instance.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> CrypText is designed for short-term communication only. It‚Äôs not intended for long-term messaging or file storage. Always keep your 12-word recovery phrase safe ‚Äî without it, your identity cannot be recovered.</p>
